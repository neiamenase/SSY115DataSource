1) Doctor , on whom you are believing with your life doesn‚Äôt reply for 2 days straight, Yes 2 days straight. Doctor asked me to get some tests done and when i went back with test result she stopped replying. Shockingly my prescribed meds were over and i continuously asked for revised prescription to go ahead and still revert is awaited.

- Nice idea

The doctor was polite but gave me heck lots of medicines, asked me to get an usg neck ultrasound, and to get reviewed after 15 days.  There was no relief  so i contacted him early around 12th day. I pAid the fee.  But to my suprise in consultation He told me to go and see an ENT...

what???? in my mind i was like what ?? Who are you then ?? Are you not an ent..  you have mentioned the same in your profile.

In this case - i paid the fee twice.. wasted money on ultrasound, bought so many medicine. Wasted my time. 

Then i went to my local area ent near my home for check up and the doctor told me i have gerd and gave me a pantosec for 15 days and i got well."

I usually get one specific doctor as ‚Äúfamily doctor‚Äù who is least responsible in asking medical history or to provide any explanation of condition and provides prescription directly. First time I faced this issue, help support turned down my request and said‚Äù  family doctor cant be changed‚Äù. Recently due to lockdown I again requested for general physician for a skin issue and got the same doctor. Without asking the history he gave me a medicine which damaged my skin. Upon meeting 2 dermatologist in person they said ‚Äú the prescription given by practo doc shouldn‚Äôt be recommended, it will only worsen the condition‚Äù. Later, I consulted Help support and again they were irresponsible and said ‚Äú We cant intervene in doctor‚Äôs prescription inquiry‚Äù. 

I suffered a skin damage and permanent scar. I hold doctor responsible who is remotely sitting in other city and ruining patient‚Äôs health.

App_Store_Review,India,practo,2020-5-11,en,Excellent
App_Store_Review,India,practo,2020-5-10,en,"Hi all,

I had used practo for my consultation (paid) due to the Covid 19 pandemic to avoid getting out of my home.

I had minor cuts which were developed due to drying up of the skin on my index finger and thumb of right hand and a little part of the same condition on my left hand thumb.

So i got the consultation done from a Dermatologist through practo app which proved to be fatal for me.
Firstly the doctor asked me to upload pics of affected fingers which i did however the app is so cheap and pathetic that after uploading the pics on the app the picture quality was getting severely blurred. I also tried taking the pictures through the camera option of the practo app but again the same results( please note i use an iphone 2019 model, so no chance of bad picture quality). So once i noticed it and the doctor did also notice the same so i asked the doctor for a video call on the app which was an option as i had paid for it but the doctor denied that and rather asked for an audio call. So i explained everything to the doctor over the audio call and i had also informed the practo doctor that i had consulted a dermatologist previously as well and the previously consulted dermatologist had told me that it is not any fungal infection but due to drying of my skin and hence he had prescribed moisturiser and anti allergic. 

So after hearing all this the Practo doctor prescribed some medicines on 5th May around Evening time and the next day i got the medicines and took them as prescribed.

 But after 3 days from the medication date which i followed religiously and took all the precautions as advised by the practo doctor. To my bad the drying up of the skin has just worsened further with the use of the medication that was prescribed by the practo doctor. Earlier it was on 55-60 % area of my index finger of right hand and around 10% on the thumb of same hand but now the drying of skin and skin shedding has spread to almost 85% on the index finger and around 70% on the thumb. Also since it was a very minor portion on the left hand thumb so I didn‚Äôt take that seriously and that logic saved my left hand thumb from further worsening.

So now i consulted my brother who is a specialist Doctor in IRELAND (who also consulted his colleagues and Dermatologists just when i asked him to double check) and then i got to know that the medication was wrong and would not heal me if i continued the same.

So I stopped the medication from today ( 10 May 2020 morning India) and i used a simple moisturiser and that helped me relive the pain as it softened the hard dry skin.

My complaint number on practo that i had raised as per practo records is 1442706

I would request everyone that please take your health seriously and do not risk anything by using the practo app. My experience has been pathetic. 
I also raised a complaint on the practo app where they haven‚Äôt tried resolving my issue bit rather point me to stupid chat things giving me pre written texts from FAQ‚Äôs.

They suck big time."

I payed 300 for an orthopedic consultancy - the doc refused to do a video/ audio call. He just chatted and gave a prescription. I requested that he do a video call to see the hurting thumb / but he didn‚Äôt think it was necessary.

It‚Äôs a money making scam! Tried to give feedback on the doc and the app makes it so painful.

App_Store_Review,Sweden,kry,2021-1-7,sv,Alltid fantastiskt bem√∂tande!
App_Store_Review,Sweden,kry,2021-1-4,sv,Det g√•r snabbt och l√§tt att f√• tag p√• en sjuksk√∂terska eller l√§kare hos Kry. Det √§r ocks√• s√• oerh√∂rt bekv√§mt att sitta hemma i lugn och ro under samtalet. Jag k√§nner mig mindre stressad att sitta hemma och prata √§n att sitta p√• en v√•rdcentral eller liknande.
App_Store_Review,Sweden,kry,2020-12-29,sv,"Bokade m√∂te via appen och fick d√• ange vilken √•komma jag s√∂kte f√∂r. Jag informerades om att min √•komma kunde kr√§va fysiskt bes√∂k p√• v√•rdcentral och fick svara p√• ytterligare fr√•gor om mina besv√§r i ett digitalt formul√§r, s√• l√•ngt allt ok. 

D√§refter fick jag fr√•gan om jag ville registrera mig p√• Kry v√•rdcentral. Jag accepterade och fick en bokningsbekr√§ftelse till ett ‚ÄùDrop-in m√∂te‚Äù. Jag f√∂rs√∂kte f√∂rst√• om det var ett videom√∂te eller ett fysiskt m√∂te jag f√∂rv√§ntades delta i, men det framgick inte. Eftersom det var s√∂ndag och inte gick att f√• tag p√• Kry via telefon s√• √•kte jag till v√•rdcentralen. P√• v√§g dit blev jag uppringd av l√§kare som sa att jag hade bokat ett m√∂te med honom digitalt. Han sade att mina besv√§r kr√§ver bes√∂k p√• fysisk mottagning enligt vad jag svarat i formul√§ret. Han sa jag skulle googla fram kontaktuppgifter till Kry v√•rdcentral och boka tid.

Eftersom jag hunnit n√§stan √§nda fram till Kry v√•rdcentral s√• gick jag dit ist√§llet. Jag beskrev f√∂r en ung tjej i receptionen att jag ville boka ett fysiskt m√∂te men hon trodde inte jag kunde g√∂ra det d√§r. Hon gick iv√§g och fr√•gade n√•gon personal bakom kulisserna, kom tillbaka och sa att l√§kare jag tr√§ffar i videotj√§nsten m√•ste g√∂ra detta.

Jag bokade s√•ledes ett nytt videom√∂te med l√§kare och fick v√§nta ytterligare n√•gon halvtimme innan han ringde upp. Han sade att det inte finns n√•gra tider under dagen (√§ven om mottagningen hade s√∂ndags√∂ppet) och inte heller n√§sta dag trots att Kry lovar tid p√• v√•rdcentral inom 24 timmar. Jag fr√•gade hur detta kunde komma sig och han sade att han inte kunde g√∂ra n√•gonting √•t eller ta ansvar f√∂r det.

V√§l p√• plats 40 timmar senare s√• fick jag b√§sta t√§nkbara bem√∂tande p√• ett s√§tt jag inte f√•tt p√• andra mottagningar. Det var v√§rt strulet, √§ven om jag m√•ste inv√§nta planerade uppf√∂ljningsm√∂ten f√∂r att se vad Kry och Krys l√§kare verkligen g√•r f√∂r.

Jag fick ett email med fr√•gor om hur jag upplevt tj√§nsten. Jag skrev ned mina synpunkter och fick svar. Svaret indikerade dock inte att man ville √•tg√§rda otydlig och missvisande information, varf√∂r mailv√§xling uppstod. Efter mitt sista email √§r det fortfarande oklart om Kry f√∂rst√•tt behovet att f√∂rtydliga och korrigera informationen i appen och p√• hemsidan. Svaren handlade bara om att man vill hj√§lpa mig vidare, inte att man t√§nker f√∂r√§ndra n√•got."
App_Store_Review,Sweden,kry,2020-12-28,sv,Jag blev mottagen p√• ett v√§ldigt professionellt s√§tt. L√§karen lyssnat och tagit mina besv√§r p√• allvar. Remissen kom p√• en g√•ng. Toppen! J√§tte n√∂jd

Har tidigare varit n√∂jd med kry, men inte senast. Fick tr√§ffa en l√§kare som uppenbart inte f√∂rstod svenska fullt ut eller hade det som f√∂rsta spr√•k. √Ñven om man kan prata svenska s√• betyder inte det att man f√∂rst√•r nyanserna i spr√•ket eller f√∂rst√•r alla ord. K√§nde att jag fick prata ‚Äùbebisspr√•k‚Äù f√∂r att samtalet skulle fungera. Han fr√•gade hur m√•nga ml eller gram det var p√• helt olika mediciner (olika verksamma √§mnen) och j√§mf√∂rde dem som om det vore samma verksamma √§mne! Det var helt olika verkningsmekanismer.

Visst var han trevlig men jag f√•r v√§nda mig n√•gon annanstans. Tur att det inte var n√•got allvarligt. 

Sn√§lla! Ni m√•ste kolla att era l√§kare kan spr√•ket fullt ut! Han kunde s√§kert massor men det hj√§lper ju inte om det blir missf√∂rst√•nd eller kommunikationen brister.

Dessutom har jag f√•tt k√§nslan av att era l√§kare sitter hemma? Man h√∂r barn st√∂ka i bakgrunden och de k√§nns inte direkt som om de bara har koncentrationen p√• jobbet :/"

1) Doctor , on whom you are believing with your life doesn‚Äôt reply for 2 days straight, Yes 2 days straight. Doctor asked me to get some tests done and when i went back with test result she stopped replying. Shockingly my prescribed meds were over and i continuously asked for revised prescription to go ahead and still revert is awaited.

- Nice idea

When i say, best doctor , the word best is not hide while publishing the feedback but when we say bad/worst doctor, why these words are barred from being published. This is hiw you give feedback rt?

The doctor was polite but gave me heck lots of medicines, asked me to get an usg neck ultrasound, and to get reviewed after 15 days.  There was no relief  so i contacted him early around 12th day. I pAid the fee.  But to my suprise in consultation He told me to go and see an ENT...

what???? in my mind i was like what ?? Who are you then ?? Are you not an ent..  you have mentioned the same in your profile.

In this case - i paid the fee twice.. wasted money on ultrasound, bought so many medicine. Wasted my time. 

Then i went to my local area ent near my home for check up and the doctor told me i have gerd and gave me a pantosec for 15 days and i got well."

App_Store_Review,India,practo,2020-5-17,en,"I took their plan which had free consultation with general physician (randomly provided by practo) along with other perks such as reimbursement.

I usually get one specific doctor as ‚Äúfamily doctor‚Äù who is least responsible in asking medical history or to provide any explanation of condition and provides prescription directly. First time I faced this issue, help support turned down my request and said‚Äù  family doctor cant be changed‚Äù. Recently due to lockdown I again requested for general physician for a skin issue and got the same doctor. Without asking the history he gave me a medicine which damaged my skin. Upon meeting 2 dermatologist in person they said ‚Äú the prescription given by practo doc shouldn‚Äôt be recommended, it will only worsen the condition‚Äù. Later, I consulted Help support and again they were irresponsible and said ‚Äú We cant intervene in doctor‚Äôs prescription inquiry‚Äù. 

I suffered a skin damage and permanent scar. I hold doctor responsible who is remotely sitting in other city and ruining patient‚Äôs health.

App_Store_Review,India,practo,2020-5-11,en,Excellent
App_Store_Review,India,practo,2020-5-10,en,"Hi all,

I had used practo for my consultation (paid) due to the Covid 19 pandemic to avoid getting out of my home.

I had minor cuts which were developed due to drying up of the skin on my index finger and thumb of right hand and a little part of the same condition on my left hand thumb.

So i got the consultation done from a Dermatologist through practo app which proved to be fatal for me.
Firstly the doctor asked me to upload pics of affected fingers which i did however the app is so cheap and pathetic that after uploading the pics on the app the picture quality was getting severely blurred. I also tried taking the pictures through the camera option of the practo app but again the same results( please note i use an iphone 2019 model, so no chance of bad picture quality). So once i noticed it and the doctor did also notice the same so i asked the doctor for a video call on the app which was an option as i had paid for it but the doctor denied that and rather asked for an audio call. So i explained everything to the doctor over the audio call and i had also informed the practo doctor that i had consulted a dermatologist previously as well and the previously consulted dermatologist had told me that it is not any fungal infection but due to drying of my skin and hence he had prescribed moisturiser and anti allergic. 

So after hearing all this the Practo doctor prescribed some medicines on 5th May around Evening time and the next day i got the medicines and took them as prescribed.

 But after 3 days from the medication date which i followed religiously and took all the precautions as advised by the practo doctor. To my bad the drying up of the skin has just worsened further with the use of the medication that was prescribed by the practo doctor. Earlier it was on 55-60 % area of my index finger of right hand and around 10% on the thumb of same hand but now the drying of skin and skin shedding has spread to almost 85% on the index finger and around 70% on the thumb. Also since it was a very minor portion on the left hand thumb so I didn‚Äôt take that seriously and that logic saved my left hand thumb from further worsening.

So now i consulted my brother who is a specialist Doctor in IRELAND (who also consulted his colleagues and Dermatologists just when i asked him to double check) and then i got to know that the medication was wrong and would not heal me if i continued the same.

So I stopped the medication from today ( 10 May 2020 morning India) and i used a simple moisturiser and that helped me relive the pain as it softened the hard dry skin.

My complaint number on practo that i had raised as per practo records is 1442706

I would request everyone that please take your health seriously and do not risk anything by using the practo app. My experience has been pathetic. 
I also raised a complaint on the practo app where they haven‚Äôt tried resolving my issue bit rather point me to stupid chat things giving me pre written texts from FAQ‚Äôs.

They suck big time."
App_Store_Review,India,practo,2020-5-5,en,Booked an appointment with the doctor and paid a hefty amount of 1500. He did not bother to reply. I also don‚Äôt know how to get my money back. It‚Äôs just a con app.

There is no easy way to claim a refund if you are genuinely unhappy with the service.

I payed 300 for an orthopedic consultancy - the doc refused to do a video/ audio call. He just chatted and gave a prescription. I requested that he do a video call to see the hurting thumb / but he didn‚Äôt think it was necessary.

It‚Äôs a money making scam! Tried to give feedback on the doc and the app makes it so painful.

Tried to chat and complain and again so painful..

App_Store_Review,India,practo,2020-4-29,en,"It is a great app for booking appointments, finding doctors, buying medicines etc. The problem lies in the consult a doctor feature of the app. I do not question the credibility of a doctor, never will, but inherently without seeing you and just knowing the symptoms that too very precursory, will not help a doctor in guiding you in the right way. I was recently diagnosed with the Ramsay Hunter Syndrome Type 2. If I had relied on the particular feature of the app, I would have kept on taking the anti bacterial making my condition worse and that did in fact cause an extreme case of facial palsy. With proper care and exercise, I can get my nerve working again hopefully, but one day more and I would have completely lost movements in my right face entirely throughout my life. Still I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever get my face back but I might. I do not want an apology or a discount or anything, but please, you need to remove the feature or at least make it a little better so there are no bots and this does not happen with someone else."
